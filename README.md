I'm doing this because I don't have money to spend on premium at the Bazi Calculator website

Soon I will discover how to calculate de element of the hour sign

Soon I will fix all the bugs on this code

All soon

Until "soon" arrives, it is what it is


And remember: yang signs have their elements on the yang side. Yin signs have their elements on the yin side.

🐀 Rat: Yang

🐃 Ox: Yin

🐅 Tiger: Yang

🐈 Rabbit: Yin

🐉 Dragon: Yang

🐍 Snake: Yin

🐎 Horse:  Yang

🐐 Goat: Yin

🐒 Monkey: Yang

🐓 Rooster: Yin

🐕 Dog: Yang

🐖 Pig: Yin

So, a Wood Dragon is Dragon of Yang Wood or 甲辰 ("jia chen").
